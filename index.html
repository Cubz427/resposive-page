                    <p>A fixed-gear bike is a bike with only one gear. Fixed-gear bikes are often revered for their visual simplicity and minimalist design.

                        Fixed-gear bikes are also called fixies and you will often hear the term used interchangeably.
                        A fixed-gear bike requires continuous pedaling. Unlike a typical bike, a fixed gear bike does not allow you to coast. Most bikes have a freewheel cog that allows the wheel to move independently of the pedals. With a fixed gear, you must pedal (even while riding downhill).
                        Fixed-gears usually include both a front and rear brake. However, fixie purists stick to only a front brake.
                        Many cyclists prefer the simplicity of a fixed-gear bike because they are easy to maintain due to there being fewer moving components that may get damaged and need to be replaced.
                        They are also often less expensive and lighter than a conventional multi-geared bike, making them excellent commuting bikes.</p>

                        Because the bicycle’s history is contentious at best, determining when the first fixie was created outside of a general “19th-century” response is difficult. However, when fixie bikes gained popularity among both Americans and Europeans, they were used by the postal courier system in the 1800s for the transportation of vital business papers.
                        Bicycles started taking a more contemporary look with the Lawson safety bike, wich allowed you to steer the bike with the handlebars.

                                Fixed gear bikes remained enormously popular in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Major cities like New York City often sponsored massive track races, and Madison Square Garden began hosting a velodrome track in 1876. As a consequence, these events became known as the “Madison races.” In these team races, participants pushed themselves to the limit, circling the course until they were “tagged” into the race.Track racing was (and continues to be) dominated by fixed gear bikes. While the sport of track racing has evolved throughout time, the usage of fixed-gear bikes has remained consistent.And, due to the popularity of fixed geared bikes, many road bike competitors were already acquainted with them, and fixed gear bikes remain a popular off-season training option for road cyclists since they provide a unique exercise and help them improve their pedal cadence.
